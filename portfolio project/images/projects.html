              If I am not wrong, people have started traveling even before civilization. Traveling helps to connect people and build social bonding. In the present time, traveling is the best way to get out of a busy schedule. It becomes a crucial part of life and a good remedy for stress, anxiety, and depression. People now explore the world and want to meet with different people, cultures, and culinary. For that reason, the traveling and tourism industry is one of the biggest and increasing initiatives worldwide and booming every day. But before starting the journey, they want to get a decent idea about that.

              This project's approach was thinking of it as a client reached with an idea for its website. From that idea, I gave myself creative freedom, so it will not look 100% the same. It will contain all features and sections, but they may look and feel different.
                  Some small details may change for any of the following reasons:
                  The original color schema is not in-line with the subject. For this, I provide an alternative color schema that fits better.
                  There are some changes in color, backgrounds, borders, shadows, and tints to improve contrast and usability; and draw the user's attention to the intended part of the site.
                  The footer bar is over-simplified on purpose because a heavily filled and high-contrast footer may distract the user from reaching the core information, which is the ultimate goal.
                  When designing the results cards, I decided to make them similar to Bootstrap cards because users may want a sneak peek of the actual content to click the result, rather than a picture and a name.
                   The original design uses a background image with white text in the middle because a sneak peeks is not as valuable as, for example, the distance from the user to the school.

              Taking into account the majority approach, I used Google. I start simply by typing “logo designer portfolio” in the search bar and hope to find a real person who could create my logo. And there it is, a bunch of potential logo designers there for the taking. I browse through their websites, and they all seem to be pretty good. Now, to make a choice, it is just a question of preferences, taste and the budget.
